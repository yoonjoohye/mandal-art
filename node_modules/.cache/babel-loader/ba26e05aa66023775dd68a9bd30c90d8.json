Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\n\n\nvar IndexedDbPersistence =\n/** @class */\nfunction () {\n  function IndexedDbPersistence(allowTabSynchronization, persistenceKey, clientId, platform, lruParams, queue, serializer, sequenceNumberSyncer) {\n    this.allowTabSynchronization = allowTabSynchronization;\n    this.persistenceKey = persistenceKey;\n    this.clientId = clientId;\n    this.queue = queue;\n    this.sequenceNumberSyncer = sequenceNumberSyncer;\n    this._started = false;\n    this.isPrimary = false;\n    this.networkEnabled = true;\n    /** Our window.unload handler, if registered. */\n\n    this.windowUnloadHandler = null;\n    this.inForeground = false;\n    /** Our 'visibilitychange' listener if registered. */\n\n    this.documentVisibilityHandler = null;\n    /** The client metadata refresh task. */\n\n    this.clientMetadataRefresher = null;\n    /** The last time we garbage collected the client metadata object store. */\n\n    this.lastGarbageCollectionTime = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\n    /** A listener to notify on primary state changes. */\n\n    this.primaryStateListener = function (_) {\n      return Promise.resolve();\n    };\n\n    this.referenceDelegate = new IndexedDbLruDelegate(this, lruParams);\n    this.dbName = persistenceKey + IndexedDbPersistence.MAIN_DATABASE;\n    this.serializer = new LocalSerializer(serializer);\n    this.document = platform.document;\n    this.targetCache = new IndexedDbTargetCache(this.referenceDelegate, this.serializer);\n    this.indexManager = new IndexedDbIndexManager();\n    this.remoteDocumentCache = new IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache(this.serializer, this.indexManager);\n\n    if (platform.window && platform.window.localStorage) {\n      this.window = platform.window;\n      this.webStorage = this.window.localStorage;\n    } else {\n      throw new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, 'IndexedDB persistence is only available on platforms that support LocalStorage.');\n    }\n  }\n\n  IndexedDbPersistence.getStore = function (txn, store) {\n    if (txn instanceof IndexedDbTransaction) {\n      return SimpleDb.getStore(txn.simpleDbTransaction, store);\n    } else {\n      throw fail('IndexedDbPersistence must use instances of IndexedDbTransaction');\n    }\n  };\n\n  IndexedDbPersistence.createIndexedDbPersistence = function (options) {\n    return tslib.__awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n      var persistence;\n      return tslib.__generator(this, function (_a) {\n        switch (_a.label) {\n          case 0:\n            if (!IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable()) {\n              throw new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR_MSG);\n            }\n\n            persistence = new IndexedDbPersistence(options.allowTabSynchronization, options.persistenceKey, options.clientId, options.platform, options.lruParams, options.queue, options.serializer, options.sequenceNumberSyncer);\n            return [4\n            /*yield*/\n            , persistence.start()];\n\n          case 1:\n            _a.sent();\n\n            return [2\n            /*return*/\n            , persistence];\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  /**\r\n   * Attempt to start IndexedDb persistence.\r\n   *\r\n   * @return {Promise<void>} Whether persistence was enabled.\r\n   */\n\n\n  IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.start = function () {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    assert(!this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence double-started!');\n    assert(this.window !== null, \"Expected 'window' to be defined\");\n    return SimpleDb.openOrCreate(this.dbName, SCHEMA_VERSION, new SchemaConverter(this.serializer)).then(function (db) {\n      _this.simpleDb = db;

Specifically the server splits paths into segments first and then\n * sorts, putting end-of-segment before any character. In a UTF-8 string\n * encoding the slash ('/') that denotes the end-of-segment naturally comes\n * after other characters so the intent here is to encode the path delimiters in\n * such a way that the resulting strings sort naturally.\n *\n * Resource paths are also used for prefix scans so it's important to\n * distinguish whole segments from any longer segments of which they might be a\n * prefix. For example, it's important to make it possible to scan documents in\n * a collection \"foo\" without encountering documents in a collection \"foobar\".\n *\n * Separate from the concerns about resource path ordering and separation,\n * On Android, SQLite imposes additional restrictions since it does not handle\n * keys with embedded NUL bytes particularly well. Rather than change the\n * implementation we keep the encoding identical to keep the ports similar.\n *\n * Taken together this means resource paths when encoded for storage in\n * IndexedDB have the following characteristics:\n *\n *   * Segment separators (\"/\") sort before everything else.\n *   * All paths have a trailing separator.\n *   * NUL bytes do not exist in the output, since IndexedDB doesn't treat them\n * well.\n *\n * Therefore resource paths are encoded into string form using the following\n * rules:\n *\n *   * '\\x01' is used as an escape character.\n *   * Path separators are encoded as \"\\x01\\x01\"\n *   * NUL bytes are encoded as \"\\x01\\x10\"\n *   * '\\x01' is encoded as \"\\x01\\x11\"\n *\n * This encoding leaves some room between path separators and the NUL byte\n * just in case we decide to support integer document ids after all.\n *\n * Note that characters treated specially by the backend ('.', '/', and '~')\n * are not treated specially here. This class assumes that any unescaping of\n * resource path strings into actual ResourcePath objects will handle these\n * characters there.\n */\nexport type EncodedResourcePath = string;\n\nconst escapeChar = '\\u0001';\nconst encodedSeparatorChar = '\\u0001';\nconst encodedNul = '\\u0010';\nconst encodedEscape = '\\u0011';\n\n/**\n * Encodes a resource path into a IndexedDb-compatible string form.\n */\nexport function encode(path: ResourcePath): EncodedResourcePath {\n  let result = '';\n  for (let i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {\n    if (result.length > 0) {\n      result = encodeSeparator(result);\n    }\n    result = encodeSegment(path.get(i), result);\n  }\n  return encodeSeparator(result);\n}\n\n/** Encodes a single segment of a resource path into the given result */\nfunction encodeSegment(segment: string, resultBuf: string): string {\n  let result = resultBuf;\n  const length = segment.length;\n  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n    const c = segment.charAt(i);\n    switch (c) {\n      case '\\0':\n        result += escapeChar + encodedNul;\n        break;\n      case escapeChar:\n        result += escapeChar + encodedEscape;\n        break;\n      default:\n        result += c;\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\n/** Encodes a path separator into the given result */\nfunction encodeSeparator(result: string): string {\n  return result + escapeChar + encodedSeparatorChar;\n}\n\n/**\n * Decodes the given IndexedDb-compatible string form of a resource path into\n * a ResourcePath instance.

Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nexport
